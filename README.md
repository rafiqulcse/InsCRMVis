Abstract

Analysis of claims and risk management is the key task to avoid frauds and to provide risk management in the life insurance industry. Though visualization plays a fundamental role in supporting analysis tasks of the business domain, analyzing user behaviour remains a challenging task. The prevalence of natural language interactions aided with data visualization has become quite the norm. With the increasing demand of visualization tools and varying level of user expertise, it comes as no surprise the use of natural languages interface. However, the design of visual analytics tools aided with natural language interfaces (NLIs) for risk management and claim analysis requires thorough task analysis and domain expertise. In this work, we investigate an alternative approach through a natural language interaction based interactive representation such as chart, pie, and histogram, which can be applied for investigating insurance claims and risk management. We design a new visual analytics solution (VAS) named (InsCRMVis) aided with NLIs. We present an expert evaluation of the proposed framework based on different real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a concise set of guidelines that can be used when visualizing risk to avoid the dangers in the insurance domain. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with the use of a visualization system in the insurance industry, focusing on aspects related to visualization research.
