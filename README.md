Abstract

The growth of Internet video and over-the-top transmission techniques has enabled online video service providers to deliver high quality video content to viewers. 
To maintain and improve the quality of experience, video providers need to detect unexpected issues that can highly affect the viewers’ experience. This requires 
analyzing massive amounts of video session data in order to find unexpected sequences of events. In this paper we combine sequential pattern mining and clustering
to discover such event sequences. The proposed approach applies sequential pattern mining to find frequent patterns by considering contextual and collective outliers. 
In order to distinguish between the normal and abnormal behavior of the system, we initially identify the most frequent patterns. Then a clustering algorithm is 
applied on the most frequent patterns. The generated clustering model together with Silhouette Index are used for further analysis of less frequent patterns and 
detection of potential outliers. Our results show that the proposed approach can detect outliers at the system level.
